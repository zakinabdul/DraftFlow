    steps:
    # Step 1: Download your code
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # Step 2: Install Python 3.11 (Same as your Dockerfile)
    - name: Set up Python 3.11
      uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with:
        python-version: "3.11"
        cache: 'pip' # Caches pip dependencies to make future runs faster

    # Step 3: Try to install your dependencies
    # This checks if your requirements.txt is valid and packages exist
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        if [ -f backend/requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r backend/requirements.txt; fi

    # Step 4: Syntax Check (The "Sanity Check")
    # This compiles your Python files to bytecode. 
    # It catches syntax errors (like missing colons or indentation issues) immediately.
    - name: Check for Syntax Errors
      run: |
        python -m compileall backend/

    # Step 5: (Optional) Run Tests
    # This command tries to run pytest. "|| true" ensures the Action doesn't fail
    # if you haven't written any tests yet.
    - name: Run Tests (if any)
      run: |
        pip install pytest
        pytest backend/ || true
